<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Imagine a local AI assistant that can do anything you want. Anything that you can do on a computer, it can do. And the best part... it runs fully locally! So no worries about your data being sent to a server hidden away in the depths of the internet. 

Using Ollama and its ability to runs Large Language Models locally, this project will allow a user to interact with their computer using natural language. For instance, you can ask it to open a file, run a program, or even write a document for you. The possibilities are endless! 

I plan on using `Llama3` for the chat functionality of the assistant and `Codestral` for the code creation/executing functionality. Both of which are listed here: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library)

## MindMapping

Currently researching effective ways to do "Dependency & Security Checks" on the Python code generated by Codestral... Its proving quite difficult :(.
